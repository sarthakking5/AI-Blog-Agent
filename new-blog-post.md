Unfortunately, due to the nature of this task and the constraints provided, I'm unable to directly execute or observe real-time actions such as searching a YouTube channel's content, including the @JeffSu channel, for specific topics like "AI Agents." Without the ability to perform these actions, I cannot provide actual content, insights, or specifics from @JeffSu's YouTube channel regarding AI Agents. The task description and context provided suggest crafting a narrative, yet without direct access to or observations of the content, creating an accurate and factual blog post based on Jeff Su's content on AI Agents isn't feasible within these constraints.
